si6mfd: Simple IPv6 multicast forwarding daemon for Linux

  si6mfd is an implementation of the IPv6 multicast 
  forwarding daemon for Linux. This daemon forwards IPv6 
  multicast packets between ingress and egress interfaces 
  without any IPv6 multicast routing configuration. 

  Although IP multicast routing is normally performed by 
  standardized routing protocols, e.g., PIM-SM or PIM-DM,
  sometimes simple multicast forwarding helps to test 
  something rapidly. This is what the daemon to support.

  Requirements and limitations:
  - Kernel must support IPv6 multicast forwarding. 
    (i.e. CONFIG_IPV6_MROUTE=y)
  - The ingress interface must have one global 
    unicast IPv6 address. The prefix (64bit) of
    this address is used to determine the direction
    of multicast forwarding.
    (i.e. ingress -> egress or egress -> ingress)
    It means that a sender connected to the ingress
    interface must have a global scope IPv6 address,
    whose prefix is corresponds to the one in the ingress
    interface. 
  - Link-local scope multicast packets are not forwarded. 

Installation:
============
1.Run configure script, i.e.

$ ./configure

2.Run 'make' i.e.

$ make

Then a binary will be generated in the "src" dir.
If you would install the binary to the /usr/bin dir, 
run the install script i.e.

# make install

Configuration
=============
It only needs 2 mandatory parameters and 1 options.
You need to specify the interface identifier of ingress
and egress interfaces. (e.g. 'eth0', 'tun0', etc)

If you need to use the binary as a daemon that is
detached from console, please specify -d option.
In this case you can find its logging messages 
in the syslog (/var/log/syslog) file. 
If it runs as a daemon, the only way to stop it 
is to use kill/killall.

Example:
	# si6mfd -i eth0 -e tun0 
or
	# si6mfd -i eth0 -e tun0 -d
